# Histogram (HIST)

Given a sequence of integers and a bucket-count m, generates a
histogram of the integers in the range [0:m).  All integers in the
input must be in that range.  The output is simply a sequence of
length m, with each of the counts.

### Default Input Distributions

The test distributions are the following:

- A random sequence of n integers in the range [0:256) 
as generated by:  
`randomSeq -t int -r 256 <n> <filename>`.

- A random sequence of n integers in the range [0:100000) 
as generated by:  
`randomSeq -t int -r 100000 <n> <filename>`.

- A random sequence of n integers in the range [0:n) 
as generated by:  
`randomSeq -t int -r <n> <n> <filename>`.

- An exponential random sequence of n integers in the range [0:n)
as generated by:  
`exptSeq -t int -r <n> <n> <filename>`.

- An almost equal sequence of n integers in the range [0:n)
as generated by:  
`almostEqualSeq -t int <n>`.

For the large inputs n = 100 million, and for the small n = 10 million.

### Input and Output File Formats

The input and output data need to be in the [sequence file format](../fileFormats/sequence.html),
both with integer element types.
